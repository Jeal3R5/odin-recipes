    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>6 generation family recipe here. My great-great-grandmother was the first I'm aware of to make this dish. I remember each version and how it tasted so different between makers, even though we've all used the same recipe. The biggest difference I have found was the brand of cheese used. The type of cheese is the same but brand varies. For instance, my mother will only use Cracker Barrel brand whereas I struggle to find Cracker Barrel so went out on a limb and used Tillamook brand. Both of us are using one sharp cheddar and one extra sharp cheddar, but the difference in taste is obvious. My Aunt has her version as well but never shared her recipe with me. I have to say that I really enjoy each version the family makes. That said, I'm going to share with you the basic recipe and allow you to choose your particulars.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb macaroni noodles</li>
                * Avoid Barilla as the cheese doesn't adhere to the pasta very well
            <li>1 28oz can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
                * Hunts brand is what we prefer
                * I prefer the no-salt added, but family uses regular canned whole tomatoes
            <li>1 8oz block of Sharp Cheddar</li>
                * This can be white or orange
                * Mom's recipe uses ONLY Cracker Barrel brand
                * My recipe uses Tillamook brand
            <li>1 8oz block of Extra Sharp Cheddar</li>
                * Can be orange or white (just use the opposite color than the Sharp Cheddar, this shouldn't have a great affect in taste, and is mostly just used to add color to the recipe)
            <li>Margarine, small flecks </li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil noodles til al dente, following the time on the pasta package, usually about 7min, drain then rinse with cold water</li>
            <li>While boiling noodles, slice the sharp and extra-sharp cheeses in 1/8th inch slices</li>
                * You can also buy the pre-sliced 8oz cheese
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of boiled noodles evenly into the bottom of a 13x9in baking dish</li>
            <li>Place the cheese slices in rows/columns, as in a checkerboard fashion, alternating the sharp and extra-sharp cheese </li>
            <li>Top cheese with canned whole tomatoes</li>
                * Pull apart the whole tomatoes with your hands into bite size pieces or chunks and spread across the cheeses
            <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper over the whole dish, to taste</li>
            <li>Flick margarine randomly over dish (approx 4-5 flecks)</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 4-6 for a second layer</li>
            <li>Once assembled, place in preheated over and bake until the cheeses have melted (approx 30-45min based on preference)</li>
                * Based on preference meaning, if you would like a crunchier top, bake a little longer until cheese has browned enough to your liking. If no crunch is desired, remove from oven once cheese melts.
            <li>Allow to cool 10-15min, so as to not burn the roof of your mouth, yay cheese</li>
            <li>Serve while still warm</li>
                * Also the leftovers are pretty great cold.
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
